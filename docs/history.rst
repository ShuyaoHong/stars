STARS History
*************

Development on STARS was put on hold while the library `PySAL
<http://code.google.com/p/pysal/>`_ was given priority focus. Many of the
analytical methods first implemented in STARS were moved into the PySAL
library during this time. Until PySAL was stable and had gone through several
release versions, the plan had always been to keep STARS on the back burner.
Once PySAL was stable, the idea was to rebuild a new version of STARS that
rested on PySAL.

Another reason behind the long period since the last STARS update had to do
with the thorny nature of heterogeneous data underlying space-time analysis.
There were no standards for this data, and much exploratory programming was
done by various people around the STARS project in this regard, but nothing
ever seemed completely satisfactory. 

Fortunately, since this period the library `pandas
<http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ has appeared on the scene and offers a very
flexible, efficient and well documented library for dealing with this type of
data. As such, the current STARS project is planning on making heavy use of
pandas for data management issues which would free up development time to
focus on some of the more analytical and visualization related issues in
space-time data analysis.
